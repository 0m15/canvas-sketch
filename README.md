# canvas-sketch

A framework for generative sketching in JavaScript and the browser.

# :warning: Work in progress :warning:

This repo is heavily work in progress. For now, you can read the docs to understand more about the tool:

- [Intro - A Framework for Generative Sketching](./docs/basics.md)

### What is this used for?

The goal of this framework is to streamline the creation of various types of Canvas2D and WebGL artworks in the browser. For example, it can be used to produce:

- High-quality Gicl√©e print artwork (e.g. large framed wall art)
- SVG files that can be sent to a pen plotter, laser cutter, or other CNC machine
- Seamless GIF/MP4 animation loops
- Full-screen interactive web artwork, for e.g. for an art installation, projection mapping and VJing
- Pixel art, for example per-pixel manipulation that produces a small but pixel-perfect image
- More advanced workflows, such as exporting 3D OBJ files or a set of masks for a Risograph printer

Ultimately, `canvas-sketch` intends to be a loose collection of modules, resources, examples, and recommendations for creating generative browser art. It can be used alongside ThreeJS, regl, P5.js, or your favourite graphics library.
